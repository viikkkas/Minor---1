# Minor-I
The project is based on the real life problem of finding the shortest path from the source to the destination.
This program takes this problem into consideration and uses algorithms like floyd warshall, djkistra algorithm to find the shortest path and display to the user.
At the end it also uses travelling salesman algorithm to design a tour of selected cities.
After all the calculation, the program displays the minimum cost to the user.
The program also uses file system to store previously calculated results for future use. In case another user has the same query as any previous user, the program will first check the file for the data and display the same, otherwise it will run the algorithm again.
